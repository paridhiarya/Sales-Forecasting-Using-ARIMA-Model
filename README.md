# **Sales-Forecasting-Using-ARIMA-Model**

## _Time Series Forecasting_
The major objective of this section is to understand the general trends in the data, and gain some quick insights, and then predict and mforecast the Sales of the category "Furniture" within a given certain period of time of the  Superstore data.The statistical significance of these observations will be also tested in 'Exploratory Data Analysis'. 

The following tasks have been achieved for the given time series data:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Weekly and Monthly Resampling of Sales 
* Checking for Trends and Seasonality
* Checking for Stationarity using Rolling plots, Summary Statistics, and Statistical Tests.
* Reduce noise by Aggregation, Smoothing, and Polynomial Fitting Techniques
* Smoothing: Moving Average and Exponentially weighted moving average.
* Decomposition of a time series data into its components: trend, seasonality, and noise.
* Prediction, Forecast, Validation of forecasts, and  the dynamic Forecasts.
* Applying ARIMA model to forecast with the best values of p,d,and q (determined by correlation graphs and hyperparameter  optimizations like AIC method).
* Accuracy of predictions
* Future improvements
